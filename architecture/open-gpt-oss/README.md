## The Mission: Truly Open-Source AI

When OpenAI released its `gpt-oss` models, it provided the community with powerful **open-weights**. However, "open-weights" is not the same as open-source code. The crucial tools to replicate, understand, and build upon these models—the training and inference framework—were not included.

**This repository provides the missing piece.**

We have created a clean, high-performance, and fully open-source system that implements the `gpt-oss-20b` architecture. Our goal is to empower the community to train these models from the ground up, fostering true innovation and transparency.

This is not just a model; it's a complete toolkit.

## Core Features of this Framework

This codebase is not a toy. It's a production-grade framework for training multi-billion parameter models, built with best practices for scale and efficiency.

*   **🚀 High-Performance Distributed Training:** Built on PyTorch's **FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel)** for training massive models that don't fit on a single GPU.
*   **🧠 Advanced Model Architecture:** A faithful implementation of `gpt-oss` features:
    *   **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** using efficient `einsum` operations.
    *   **Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)** for faster inference.
    *   **Sliding Window Attention** and **Attention Sinks** for long-context efficiency.
    *   **Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE)** with YaRN-style scaling.
*   **💾 Memory-Efficient Initialization:** Uses `meta` device initialization to instantiate 20B+ parameter models on machines with limited CPU RAM.
*   **⚡️ Scalable Sharded Checkpointing:** Saves and resumes training for both model and optimizer states in a sharded format, avoiding memory bottlenecks on a single node.
*   **🌍 Hugging Face Integration:** Includes a simple script to convert native FSDP checkpoints into the standard `safetensors` format for easy sharing and use with the `transformers` library.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized for clarity and maintainability:

-   `prepare.py`: A utility to download and tokenize a dataset into a memory-mapped binary format for efficient loading.
-   `model.py`: The heart of the project. Contains the complete definition of the Transformer architecture, including all layers like MoE, GQA, etc.
-   `train.py`: The main script for launching a distributed training job using FSDP.
-   `sample.py`: A multi-GPU, FSDP-aware script for generating text from a trained checkpoint.
-   `export_to_safetensors.py`: The script to convert internal training checkpoints to a Hugging Face-compatible format.

## Getting Started: Train Your Own 20B Model

Follow these steps to train a `gpt-oss-20b` model from scratch.

### Step 1: Setup

First, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmuNaman/gpt-oss.git
cd gpt-oss
pip install -r requirements.txt # (Assuming you create a requirements.txt with torch, tiktoken, etc.)
```

### Step 2: Prepare the Dataset

We use the TinyStories dataset as an example. The `prepare.py` script will automatically download it from Hugging Face, tokenize it with the `o200k_harmony` tokenizer, and create `train.bin` and `val.bin` files in the specified directory.

```bash
python prepare.py --out_dir data/tinystories
```

### Step 3: Launch Training

The following command launches a distributed training run for the 20B model on 5 GPUs. It is the exact command used to train our proof-of-concept model.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=5 train.py \
    --model_size="20b" \
    --out_dir="out-20b-h200-stable" \
    --data_dir="data/tinystories" \
    --batch_size=1 \
    --grad_accum_steps=8 \
    --block_size=512 \
    --max_iters=5000 \
    --lr=3e-4 \
    --min_lr=3e-5 \
    --warmup_iters=100 \
    --lr_decay_iters=5000 \
    --weight_decay=0.1 \
    --beta1=0.9 \
    --beta2=0.95 \
    --dtype="bfloat16" \
    --log_interval=10 \
    --eval_interval=100 \
    --save_every=500 \
    --sample_every=100
```
**Note:** The `bfloat16` dtype is highly recommended for modern GPUs (NVIDIA Ampere/Hopper). For older GPUs, you may need to use `float16`.

## Using Your Trained Model

Once training is running, you'll have checkpoints in your `--out_dir`. Here’s how to use them.

### Running Inference from Checkpoints

Use the `sample.py` script to generate text. This script correctly handles the FSDP sharded checkpoint format and runs inference in a distributed, deadlock-free manner.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=5 sample.py \
    --out_dir out-20b-h200-stable \
    --ckpt_prefix ckpt \
    --prompt "Once upon a time there was a " \
    --max_new_tokens 200 \
    --temperature 0.8 \
    --top_k 200 \
    --dtype bfloat16
```

### Exporting to Hugging Face `safetensors`

To share your model with the world, convert the sharded FSDP checkpoints into the standard `safetensors` format.

This script gathers the full model weights onto rank 0's CPU memory and re-shards them into files of a maximum size (e.g., 5GB), creating the necessary `index.json` file for `transformers`.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=5 export_to_safetensors.py \
  --in_dir out-20b-h200-stable \
  --ckpt_prefix ckpt \
  --max_shard_size 5GB \
  --release_dir /workspace/20b-release
```
The resulting files in `/workspace/20b-release` can then be uploaded directly to the Hugging Face Hub.
## Watching the Model Learn: Sample Outputs

Here are some raw, unedited samples generated automatically during the training run. They offer a direct view into the model's learning process, showing its rapid progression from simple word association to forming coherent narrative structures and even attempting causal reasoning.

### Iteration 1000 (Validation Loss: 3.2228)

*   **Analysis:** At this stage, the model has learned to associate related concepts like "bird," "family," and "adventures." It can generate distinct story ideas separated by `<|endoftext|>`. The grammar is still developing, but a clear thematic consistency is emerging.

````text
so that mom him kept his and. the was that was of, the, he made new.Every, would himself a of and like bird made feel.

day the and bird in family so, would meet and bird a too They fly and around have adventures

they see other. bird the was that had a friend everyone it and was happy have a friend. like was the of, for bird They the, they fly and around<|endoftext|> upon time lived little named. was years, was small round shiny andly and. liked sleep day went sleep night

day as was, sun shining and got
````
### Iteration 1500 (Validation Loss: 2.9272)

*   **Analysis:** A significant leap in reasoning. The model now attempts to form causal links, trying to use the word "because" to justify an outcome (was because diamond). It's building more complex scenes with characters ("Tim"), family members, and locations ("stadium").

````text
saw big. was. big was big small shiny the. felt andly it so. knew had something to the.

was happy find shiny. knew what the was it to. thought was very and wanted know was it the thing do So put in pocket went and the found pretty. carefully out the and diamond The diamond so, was happy it found goldThe. felt a lucky. knew it done right. was because diamond<|endoftext|> upon time there a boy Tim was excited go the with family They going the to stadium Tim family He to and mom dad him a called. they to the and became happy
````
### Iteration 1900 (Validation Loss: 2.8464)

*   **Analysis:** This is the final checkpoint we exported. The model is now attempting to maintain character consistency across sentences ("He a3 old who to... He his..."). It sets scenes with greater detail ("through door," "for birthday," "with big on top") and introduces narrative tension ("Suddenly he a noise").

````text
never back.Once down with that and can fun together<|endoftext|> upon time there a who to his year He a3 old who to. day was through door his to, for birthday He his in park He his and was with big on top Suddenly he a noise him to. was very - big!

ey dad, and were his, for. were to him. dad, him it a! was to him They very. was excited see the and could the.

## Our Proof-of-Concept Model

To demonstrate that our codebase works, we trained a model with the commands above and have shared it on the Hugging Face Hub.

**➡️ [omunaman/Open_Source_GPT_OSS_20B](https://huggingface.co/omunaman/Open_Source_GPT_OSS_20B)**

This model is a checkpoint from a very early stage of training (**only 1900 iterations**). Its primary purpose is to serve as a tangible validation of this open-source code.
